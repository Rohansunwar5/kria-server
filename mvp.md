MVP – CORE RULES  
Sports
•	 Badminton (ACTIVE)
•	Other sports → Coming Soon (visible, disabled)
Human-assisted MVP philosophy
•	Auctions → partially manual (staff-assisted)
•	Scoring → recorded by staff
•	Organizers + Staff share the same portal
•	App = single source of truth + transparency layer
________________________________________
1. TOURNAMENT STRUCTURE  
Tournament → Categories → Matches
A Tournament can contain multiple Categories.
Examples
•	Under 21 – Women (Doubles)
•	Under 18 – Singles
•	Men – Doubles
Each category is independent in:
•	Match format
•	Points system
•	Bracket logic
•	Leaderboards & rankings
________________________________________
2. TOURNAMENT SETUP (ORGANIZER / STAFF PORTAL)
Mandatory Pre-Registration Setup
Create Tournament
 → Add Teams (mandatory)
 → Create Categories
 → Define Auction Type
 → Set Team Budgets
 → Open Player Registration
________________________________________
Team Setup (Mandatory, Before Registration)
For each team:
•	Team name
•	Team logo / color (optional MVP)
•	Team owner / representative
•	WhatsApp group link (can be added later)
🚫 Registration is blocked until teams exist
This enforces structure and prevents chaos.
________________________________________
Category Setup  
For each category:
•	Category name
•	Gender
•	Singles / Doubles
•	Age group
•	Points per game (dynamic)
o	e.g. 18 / 21 / 25
•	Match format
o	Best of 1 / Best of 3
•	Bracket type
o	League
o	Knockout
o	League → Top N → Knockout (hybrid)
________________________________________
Sport Configuration (DESIGN DECISION)
Approach: Global Defaults + Category Overrides

SportConfig is a GLOBAL, system-level entity:
•	Pre-seeded by admin (badminton, cricket, football, etc.)
•	Read-only for organizers
•	Contains: scoring rules, team sizes, format options

Organizers customize at CATEGORY level:
•	Override pointsPerGame (21 → 15)
•	Override bestOf (3 → 1)
•	Category stores final match rules

Why this approach:
•	Consistency: All "Badminton" tournaments share base rules
•	Flexibility: Each category can have custom scoring
•	Simplicity: Less duplication, easy to maintain

Future: Add Admin role to lock SportConfig mutations
